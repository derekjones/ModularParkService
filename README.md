# Modular Park Service for VCV Rack

Welcome to the official repository for Modular Park Service, a collection of custom modules designed for use in VCV Rack, the open-source virtual Eurorack synthesizer. This project is a synthesis (pun intended) of my love for the US National Park Service and DSP/virtual analog. This project is a work in progress and work is planned for a slew (pun intended) of other NPS inspired modules.

## Features

The modules released here are beta versions ready for testing.

## Installation

To install these modules in VCV Rack, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the Releases section.
2. Extract the downloaded file.
3. Place the extracted folder into your VCV Rack plugins directory.
4. Restart VCV Rack.
